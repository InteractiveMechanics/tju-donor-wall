# interactivemechanics-basic-project
A basic project template that we can keep building on for starting new web projects. Right now, this is pretty simple: just a basic structure for working with Sass so we're all on the same page with Grunt for automation. It also automatically installs jQuery and Bootstrap.

### Instructions
*  Start your new project by downloading the zipped version.
*  From terminal, run `npm install` to get all the dependencies.
*  Start editing! Don't commit back to this repo unless you're making changes to it.

### Grunt Commands
#### grunt
Runs the basic watch command, which processes Sass and waits for changes.

#### grunt startServer
Runs a server on `localhost:4000` and watches for changes.

#### grunt production
Compiles Sass, removes console.log().
